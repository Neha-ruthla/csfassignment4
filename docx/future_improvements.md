There are several improvements that I plan to add in the future to make the portfolio more advanced:

Adding more interactivity using JavaScript, such as animations or a dark/light mode.

Improving responsiveness for different devices like tablets and small screens.

Adding a detailed projects page with descriptions, screenshots, and links.

Integrating a contact form so visitors can send messages directly.

Improving the overall design with better fonts, icons, and UI components.
