The portfolio was developed using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.

I started by planning the layout and deciding what sections I wanted to include, such as Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

Then I created the basic structure using HTML.

After that, I designed the pages using CSS, focusing on clean colors, proper spacing, and a simple layout.

JavaScript was used for basic interactions such as navigation or smooth scrolling (only if you added it).
During development, I tested each section to ensure that the website worked properly on different screen sizes and looked visually balanced.
