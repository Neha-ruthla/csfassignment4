The My Portfolio project is a personal website created to showcase my skills, education, projects, and interests in a clean and organized way. The main goal of this portfolio is to provide a simple and user-friendly platform where anyone—such as teachers, classmates, or recruiters—can easily learn about me. The design is clean, responsive, and easy to navigate, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
